    <h1>Lasagna</h1>

    <h2>Description : </h2>
    <p>It is usually rectangular or ribbon shaped, thicker than tagliatelle, made from a dough based on flour and eggs, with numerous local variants. After being boiled, the rectangular lasagna noodles are drained and placed in layers with a filling that varies based on different local traditions.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients : </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ricotta or Mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Tomato Sauce</li>
        <li>Meats (grounded beef, pork or chicken)</li>
        <li>Vegetables (spinach, zucchini, olives, mushrooms)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps : </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First, spread an even layer of bolognese sauce over the base of an oven-proof dish.</li>
        <li>Then, place a single layer of pasta sheets on top. You may need to break up some of the sheets into smaller pieces to ensure they fit.</li>
        <li>Next, spread over a layer of the white sauce (or béchamel) and repeat the process until both sauces are used up.</li>
        <li>Finish with a layer of bolognese or white sauce – whichever you have left – and sprinkle with cheese (we like parmesan and cheddar).</li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>TIP : take care not to be too generous with each layer of sauce, or you’ll end up with a sloppy mess when you try to serve it.</b></p>
